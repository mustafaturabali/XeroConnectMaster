  All of the invoices listed above are not currently matched to a Salesforce Opportunity and were suggested because either the 
  Xero Invoices were either recently added, or the Salesforce Account name is similar to the Xero Account name, or because this
  Opportunity or another Opportunity on the same Salesforce Account is already matched to a Xero Invoice on the same Xero Account.<br/><br/>
  
  However, you may not find the invoice you are looking for above. To enter one or more invoices manually, you can either
  <a href="./">click here [dead link]</a> for
  a list of the 200 most recently added invoices, or <a href="./">click here [dead link]</a> for a list of all unmatched
  invoices (warning, this page may take a while to load).<br/><br/>
  Or you may enter invoice numbers manually below. To enter multiple invoices, seperate them by a single comma.<br/>

  <h1>Developers Notes</h1>
  The above page is styled badly - I do not have any graphic skill. It should look a lot more like standard View.
  But the over-all idea should be the same. A list of unmatched invoices is presented, in descending order by invoice number.
  (this way the most recently created invoice is at the top).
  The amount of the invoice and the company should be listed, as well as the Invoice Date and Due Date.
  The reason those invoices were suggested, such as recently created, or similar to Account name or previously matched on
  SF Account, should also be indicated.<br/><br/>
  Also, only 5 invoices are listed, but I think this should be a range of 10-20 invoices. How to select how many, and how to get
  a mix of the three suggestions, is potentially a complicated excercise. For the time being, do not put much focus on this, as 
  it will likely change during beta testing.<br/><br/>
  Also, just to be clear, the checkbox on the far left should be actionable by the user. The checkboxes for the reason why an invoice
  is suggested are just indicators, and should never be unchecked or checked by the user. This functionality is reproduced accurately above.
